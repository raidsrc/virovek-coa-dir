Certificates of Analysis names should look like this:
"CoA Lot 23-266 AAV5-CMV-GFP 23-271 AAV5-Empty"
That's CoA, followed by Lot, followed by the lot number and virus name of all of the viruses included in the certificate of analysis. 
Repeat if needed.
"CoA Lot 00-001 AAV1-Empty 00-002 AAV2-Empty 00-003 AAV3-Empty"
If it gets exceedingly long, remove the ampersands and virus names.
"CoA Lot 00-001 00-002 00-003 00-004 00-005"

Sometimes I'll need to make a copy of a pdf if there is CoA data for more than one virus on it. This is so I can put each copy in its designated virus name folder. These copies will have " - Copy" at the end.
